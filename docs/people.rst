People behind FitPy
===================

Who are the people behind the FitPy framework?

The FitPy framework is the result of over a decade of personal development in the field of data analysis software of its main author and maintainer, **Till Biskup**. For more information, you may want to check out my `personal homepage <https://www.till-biskup.de/>`_ and my webpage on `reproducible research <https://www.reproducible-research.de/>`_.

The ideas presented have evolved over long time, and many people have helped shape the ideas eventually leading to the framework.
