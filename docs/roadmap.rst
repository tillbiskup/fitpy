Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* General implementation of the interfaces

* Dedicated plotters

  * Inspired by the plotting capabilities of lmfit

  * Automatic plotting of both, data and fitted model

* Reporting capabilities

* Semi-stochastic sampling of starting conditions (Latin hypercube sampling, LHS)



For later versions
==================

* Global fitting of several datasets at once

  * Sharing all or only a selection of parameters

  * Defining offsets for a parameter for the different datasets

* Fitting of several concurrent models (*i.e.*, "species") to one dataset

* Omitting regions of data from fitting


Todos
=====

A list of todos, extracted from the code and documentation itself, and only meant as convenience for the main developers. Ideally, this list will be empty at some point.
