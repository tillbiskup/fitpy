A note on the logo
------------------

The logo shows a Latin square, usually attributed to Leonhard Euler. In the context of statistical sampling, a Latin square consists of only one sample in each row and each column. Its *n*-dimensional generalisation, the Latin hypercube, is used to generate a near-random sample of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution in statistics, e.g., for obtaining sets of starting parameters for minimisation and fitting tasks. The logo shows a snake (obviously a Python) distributed such over a 4x4 square that it visits each row and each column only once. The copyright of the logo belongs to J. Popp.
