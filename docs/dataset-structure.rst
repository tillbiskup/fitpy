The dataset is an essential :doc:`concept <concepts>` of the ASpecD framework, and hence of the FitPy package.

Developers frequently need to get an overview of the structure of the dataset as defined in the FitPy package. Whereas the API documentation of  :class:`fitpy.dataset.CalculatedDataset` provides a lot of information, a simple and accessible presentation of the dataset structure is often what is needed.

Therefore, the structure of dataset class is provided below in YAML format, automatically generated from the actual source code.
